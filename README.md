    <h2>About The Project: </h2>
    <p>
     The project is made in python and in this project user has to send or solve a secret message recived by the program<br>
     at first user will have to choose a option below for writing the message or either for solving it<br>
     if user chooses to write then the user will have to write any message and get the secret message code for it<br>
     now then the message is secret the reciver will have to acess is by the code message got by user<br>
     if the message is correct than program will solve the code and show real message behind it<br>
     otherwise it will ask to enter a valid message and show no solved message in the output<br>
     This project is made using time and random module i used time for showing the loading time and<br>
     add a feel about the writing and solving message by the program and the random module<br>
     is for making the message into secret message also i hope the user who plays this<br>
     will surely get a fun vibe while playing and user will enjoy solving the secret message by program.
